# Movecraft Combat

Bringing Movecraft to Sponge, one bug at a time!  
This project began when the Bukkit DMCA resulted in the death of Cauldron.  
We aim to fix that itch for buildable vehicles in your modded worlds, the support of SpongeVanilla is a side effect of this process.  
Some additional features are being added as a part of this process.

### The Development Process

We are currently attempting to implement Test Driven Development using Junit and Mockito.  

New GitHub issues are opened as problems are located within the codebase during development.  
Development is guided by open GitHub issues.  
Bugs, Missing Features, and Code Health are prioritised over new features.
